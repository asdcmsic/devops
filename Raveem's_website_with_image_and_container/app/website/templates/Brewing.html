            <h2>
                Coffee is made into a drink by putting the coffee into boiling water. 
                This is called "brewing" coffee. There are many ways to brew coffee. 
                Four of the most popular are:<br />

                * Boiling: The coffee and the water are put into a pot on top of the stove and boiled slowly together.<br />
                This way of making coffee has been used for hundreds of years. <br />
                It is the way that coffee is usually made in the Middle East, North Africa, Turkey and Greece.[4]<br />

                * Pressure: The boiling water is forced through the ground coffee by a machine.<br />
                This type of coffee is called Espresso and the machine is called an "Espresso machine" or "Coffee system".<br />
                Espresso machines are often found in cafes and restaurants. Espresso is a very <br />
                strong coffee that can be used to make other coffee drinks.[5]<br />

                * Gravity: Filtered coffee is made by gravity because the boiling water falls from a machine onto the coffee.<br />
                The coffee grounds are held in a paper or metal "filter" that the water can run through, but the little coffee pieces cannot.<br />
                The water becomes coloured and flavoured as it runs through the coffee and into a coffee pot.[6]<br />

                * Steeping: Boiling water is poured onto the coffee and it is allowed to stand for a little while, until the water has taken the colour and flavour.<br /> 
                This is often done in a cafeti√®re, which is a tall glass or coffee pot which has a special filter inside that can be <br />
                pushed down when the coffee is ready so that the person does not drink the coffee grounds. <br />
                Another way of steeping coffee is to have coffee grounds in a small packet, the right size to make one cup of coffee.<br /> 
                The packet is placed in the cup and water poured over it. Then the packet is removed.[7]<br />
