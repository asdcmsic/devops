        <h2>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans,
        the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. All fruit 
        must be further processed from a raw material—the fruit and seed—into a 
        stable, raw product; un-roasted, green coffee. To process the berries, 
        the seed is separated from the fruit to produce green coffee. Green coffee 
        is then roasted, a process which transforms the raw product (green coffee) 
        into a consumable product (roasted coffee). Roasted coffee is ground into a 
        powder and mixed with water to produce a cup of coffee.
        Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in 
        humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.[3] It is one of the most popular drinks in the 
        world,[4] and can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, 
        caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually served hot, 
        although chilled or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, 
        milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste. It may be served with coffee cake or 
        another sweet dessert like doughnuts. A commercial establishment that sells prepared coffee 
        beverages is known as a coffee shop (not to be confused with Dutch coffeeshops selling cannabis).</h2>
