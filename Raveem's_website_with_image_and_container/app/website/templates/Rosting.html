        <h2>
            Roasting
                "Roasting" is one of the important stages in 
                making coffee beans into coffee. When a coffee bean is roasted, 
                it grows nearly two times bigger and changes from green to yellow to brown.
                The length of time that the coffee beans are roasted makes the coffee taste 
                different. Some types of coffee, such as Mocha and Java, are roasted for a short time. 
                It is easy to tell from the flavour where the coffee is from. When coffee is roasted for a long time, 
                it is harder to tell the different types apart. Green coffee beans can be bought and roasted at home in 
                the oven.
