        <h2>
            Grinding
                Before the coffee is made into a drink, 
                it is "ground" in a small grinding machine called a "coffee mill". 
                The coffee mill breaks the beans into very small pieces.
                Coffee is turned into a drink in several different ways. 
                For some ways of making coffee, such as "espresso" it is best to have the 
                coffee ground into fine powder but for other types of coffee-making, such as "filtered coffee", 
                the coffee is in larger pieces to stop it going through the filter. 
                Finely ground coffee makes a stronger taste.
